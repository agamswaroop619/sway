The Gravatar service privacy policy is available here: <a href="https://automattic.com/privacy/" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">https://automattic.com/privacy/</a>.

      <p className="py-2">
        If you leave a comment on our site you may opt-in to saving your name, email address, and website in cookies. These are for your convenience so that you do not have to fill in your details again when you leave another comment. These cookies will last for one year.

      <h2 className="my-4 font-semibold text-3xl text-white">Embedded Content from Other Websites</h2>
      <p className="py-2">
        Articles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. videos, images, articles, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.
      </p>
      <p className="py-2">
        These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.

      <h2 className="my-4 font-semibold text-3xl text-white">How Long We Retain Your Data</h2>
      <p className="py-2">
        If you leave a comment, the comment and its metadata are retained indefinitely. This is so we can recognize and approve any follow-up comments automatically instead of holding them in a moderation queue.

        For users that register on our website (if any), we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username). Website administrators can also see and edit that information.

You can also request that we erase any personal data we hold about you. This does not include any data we are obliged to keep for administrative, legal, or security purposes.
